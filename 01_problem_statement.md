# Problem Statement

## Challenges in Current Trello Prioritization:
- Trello relies on labels and manual sorting, making prioritization inefficient.
- Users manually track priority levels, leading to confusion.
- No clear mechanism to highlight high-priority tasks.

## Need for a Prioritization Feature:
- Introduce High, Medium, and Low priority levels.
- Reduce cognitive loadby automating task prioritization.
- Improve efficiency by helping users focus on urgent tasks.
